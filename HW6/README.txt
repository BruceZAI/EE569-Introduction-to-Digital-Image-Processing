Problem 2:
(a)
(1) & (2) newmain_pixelhop++.py: Compute train and test accuracy
	main.py: Compute training time and number of trainable parameters


(3) main.py: Try different TH1 to compute test accuracy and model size. 
     module 3-minist.ipynb: Plot the curve of TH1 vs. the test accuracy for MNIST
